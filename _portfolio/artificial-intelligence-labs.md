## Lab Overview

This series of artificial intelligence labs showcases four core algorithmic practices from the course: rule-driven diagnostic expert systems, fuzzy inference controllers, genetic algorithm optimization, and A* search for solving the 8-puzzle problem. The current presentation focuses on code and documentation content, screenshots are not included yet but can be added as needed.

## Lab 1: Production System and Medical Knowledge Graph

- **Key Features**:
  - GUI expert system implemented with Tkinter, supporting forward/backward reasoning, symptom selection, and diagnostic process visualization.
  - Medical knowledge graph construction with dynamic entity/relationship maintenance, visualization, full-text search, and SQLite export.
  - Complete user manual and lab report for classroom presentation or experiment reproduction.

## Lab 2: Fuzzy Inference and Washing Machine Control

- **Key Features**:
  - Inference system using fuzzy sets and rule base to process inputs such as clothing dirtiness and fabric type, outputting washing mode/duration recommendations.
  - SQLite-based maintenance of extensible fuzzy rules and sample data for easy classroom demonstration of rule addition/deletion.
  - Jupyter Notebook (`Untitled.ipynb`) for visualizing inference curves, parameter tuning, and validation.

## Lab 3: Genetic Algorithm for Optimization

- **Key Features**:
  - Binary-encoded genetic algorithm implementation covering population initialization, selection, crossover, and mutation, supporting both maximum and minimum optimization objectives.
  - Multiple script versions validate the impact of different parameter combinations (population size, crossover probability, mutation rate) on convergence curves.
  - Lab report summarizing parameter tuning insights, along with program usage documentation.

## Lab 4: A* Search for Solving the 8-Puzzle Problem

- **Key Features**:
  - A* search with configurable heuristic functions (e.g., Manhattan distance) to solve the classic 8-puzzle problem, reconstructing search paths and counting expanded nodes.
  - Clear code structure, facilitating demonstration of heuristic search and state deduplication strategies.
  - Supporting report and usage instructions help readers quickly understand the lab background and operational steps.
