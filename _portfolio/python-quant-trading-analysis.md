## Project Overview

This project is for the "Financial Quantitative Trading System Design" course, implementing quantitative trading strategy backtesting, performance evaluation, and visual analysis using Python. Through historical backtesting of multiple strategies, statistical metric calculations, and chart presentations, a complete strategy research and evaluation workflow is constructed.

## Main Content

- **Strategy Implementation**: Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, etc.) to write multiple trading strategy scripts covering typical logic such as trend following and mean reversion.
- **Backtesting Framework**: Supports custom backtesting periods, trading signals, and position management, generating complete trading records.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates key metrics including net value curves, maximum drawdown, annualized returns, monthly return distribution, rolling annualized returns, etc.
- **Result Visualization**: Outputs various statistical charts (net value, drawdown, box plots, return distribution, etc.) to assist with strategy comparison and diagnosis.
- **Report Writing**: Includes experimental reports and research documentation, organizing strategy design, data processing, and experimental conclusions.

## Technology Stack

- **Language and Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn
- **Data Source**: Historical market data provided by the course and processed CSV data
- **Analysis Methods**: Return/risk metric calculations, box plots, rolling analysis, and other quantitative evaluation methods

## Project Highlights

1. Complete workflow covering strategy implementation, backtesting, evaluation, and visualization.
2. Emphasis on combining quantitative metrics with statistical charts for intuitive strategy performance presentation.
3. Extensible to more strategies or assets, serving as a foundation template for quantitative research.
