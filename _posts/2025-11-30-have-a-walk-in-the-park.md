On the last day of November, I had a walk to the Century Park. Sunny days are always good for walks. 

## MANNER 
- It is known as the most beautiful MANNER cafeteria.

*Isn't it beautiful?*

## Amazing Green
- Great fun to have a picnic here. And I captured this sence!

## Duck Family
- The duck family came out for a stroll too.

## Ginkgo
- The ginkgo trees turn golden yellow. It signifies that late autumn has arrived.
